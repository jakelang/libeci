# libeci
libeci is a small library written in Rust for verifying the properties of ewasm bytecode.
Initially designed with the properties of the ewasm ECI (Ethereum Contract Interface) in mind, libeci can be easily expanded to support checking other properties of ewasm bytecode.

libeci is also intended, in the future, to be able to compile to WebAssembly and be called from a browser environment.
